Hi! My name is Christopher. I am a roboticist and cybernetician focused on creating cognitive space robotics. I am currently a Doctorate of Engineering in Aeronautics and Astronautics candidate at the University of Tokyo, Artificial Intelligence Lab. Furthermore, I am working on system/software architecture and autonomous agent path planning for Upper Class E Traffic Management (ETM) spacecraft at NASA Ames (Code: ARC AFT). Previously, I worked with several space groups including the European Space Agency, the Austrian Space Forum, EPFL, and the Space Generation Advisory Council to bring high-tech solutions to complex problems. I specialize in systems engineering and systems architecting domain for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and control systems for space robotics. Thank you for your interest!

I have developed MBSE architecture frameworks for ESA, Volvo, and Siemens. For CERN, I have developed extensive APIs for handling petabytes of data. Most of my projects focus on future-oriented technologies. For example, the CERN SHiP experiment in 2026, ESA's Deep Space (Copernicus and beyond) in 2030-2040, Space Suits for 2024+, and NASA ETM for 2030+. My most intensive contributions have been by combining Generative Engineering and Concurrent Engineering for space system applications development for Phase 0/A missions at Siemens. Finally, I am concurrently designing at educational space game for NASA, teaching mathematics to Grade 7-9 students.
